| Acquire | Try different actuation functions (based on [these](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view) [papers](https://rdcu.be/dIuj4) [here](https://rdcu.be/dIume) and [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7397180b88b40bb7185a165cbbfcc22d581f86c9) and [here](https://rdcu.be/dIume) or  [exploit/explore](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view)  Recall that our training curve is initially steep then goes shallow. Can we se that? | |
| Text mining| recommendation system: reporduce zhe using [this data](https://github.com/fastread/src/tree/master/workspace/data) |text tool | |
| Nshot| Few shot /1 shot learning : compare to SMO (based on [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view) and [these notes](https://github.com/txt/aa24/blob/main/docs/09size.md) | | Lohith |
| hyperband |smo+hyperband | | Andre |
| surrogate| Can SMO become a human surrogate?  | maybe text mining? | | |
| humans| SMO for a human surrogate, then (a) does human confuse AI?; (b) does AI confuse human? | | Andre, Sai Raj |
|strange| Timsâ€™s strange optimization why does it work?  (Time to ablate everything? What can change and it all still works?) | | |
| neural | Neural architecture search. Warning: slow | | |
