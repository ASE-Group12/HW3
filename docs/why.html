# Why does it work?

The results of this code are strage: large problem spaces can be explored with just a few queries.
Which is odd since conventional wisdom is that learnign requires a lot of data:

Not ebst, jsut one statistical indistinguishable from best

not n good but one good

optimzation, not classification or regression (\*)


(\*) but we thing we can do regresions/classification using NN techniques.
