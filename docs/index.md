This site is organized around a set of hand-on coding tutorials. All the code is written in Lua
(cause that is such a simple language) and, using any number of LLM tools, you can  translate  that code to anything else you want (\*).

- Setting up
  - [Editing and Debugging](dev.md)
  - [Coding experiments](Code.md)
- [Developing Code, 101](dev.md)
- [Numbers and Symbols](Numsym.md)
- Theory
  - [Algorithms](algos.md)


(\*) Of course that translation will not be perfect, but in the process of debugging the broken code you will
learn so much that is useful.
