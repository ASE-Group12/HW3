## Extend

1. Try different acqustion functions (based on [these](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view) [papers](https://rdcu.be/dIuj4) [here](https://rdcu.be/dIume) and [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7397180b88b40bb7185a165cbbfcc22d581f86c9
) and [here](https://rdcu.be/dIume)
  - Or  [exploit/explore](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view)
2. text mining, recommendation system: reporduce zhe using [this data](https://github.com/fastread/src/tree/master/workspace/data)
3. Fewshor/onehshot learning compare to smo (based on [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view) and [these notes](https://github.com/txt/aa24/blob/main/docs/09size.md).
4. SMO+hyperband (andre)
6. SMO for a human surrogate, then
   - Does human confuse ai?
   - Does ai confuse hman
7. Timsâ€™s strange optimization why does it work?
   - time to ablate everything. what can change and it all still works?
5. Neural architecture search. Warning: slow
