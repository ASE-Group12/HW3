# Why does it work?

The results of this code are strage: large problem spaces can be explored with just a few queries.
Which is odd since conventional wisdom is that learnign requires a lot of data:

TABLE

so we are cheating int aht we are handling asoewhat special case:


- Not ebst, jsut one statistical indistinguishable from best
- not n good but one good
- optimzation, not classification or regression (\*)
- even though we cannot access Y, we cana ccess x

That said, this special case covers a wide number of case studies:

- asda
- xxxx

(\*) but we thing we can do regresions/classification using NN techniques.
