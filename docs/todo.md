| Text mining, recommendation system: reporduce zhe using [this data](https://github.com/fastread/src/tree/master/workspace/data) | |
| Fewshor/onehshot learning compare to smo (based on [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBomkbXmel1z5_XAkXOcbW6WZG74hQn6/view) and [these notes](https://github.com/txt/aa24/blob/main/docs/09size.md) | |
| SMO+hyperband (andre) | |
| Can SMO become a human surrogate? to prove that, need something like the text mining study. | |
| SMO for a human surrogate, then (a) does human confuse AI?; (b) does AI confuse human? | |
| Timsâ€™s strange optimization why does it work?  (Time to ablate everything? What can change and it all still works?) | |
| Neural architecture search. Warning: slow | |
