Data

classifier
- Naive bayes
- knn (no clustering) <== can be regressions as well
- decision tree

clustering
- one sample per leaf (tiny training)
- regression and classifiication
- sample plus propergate

- lessons:
  - data reduction (just one sample per leaf)
  - when recursively clustering, use less and less to find poles.
