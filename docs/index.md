# Why Micro Modeling?

Some of us (many of us) are striving to extract valuable insights
from small, localized datasets. Not everyone has the resources to
develop models with over a trillion parameters. For those working
with these large-scale models, a reference model is essential to
test and evaluate the added value (if any) of these large models.

The advantage of micro modeling is that with fewer data points, the
learning process becomes faster, and the AI models simpler and more
explainable. This efficiency allows for rapid iteration and easier
interpretation, enabling us to unlock significant value from minimal
data.


To demonstrate this,
this site is organized around a set of hand-on coding tutorials. All the code is written in Lua
(cause that is such a simple language) and, using any number of LLM tools, you can  translate  that code to anything else you want (\*).

- Setting up
  - [Editing and Debugging](dev.md)
  - [Coding experiments](Code.md)
- [Developing Code, 101](dev.md)
- [Numbers and Symbols](Numsym.md)
- Theory
  - [Algorithms](algos.md)


(\*) Of course that translation will not be perfect, but in the process of debugging the broken code you will
learn so much that is useful.
